## 💡 Learning Tips

### 1. Active Learning
Don't just read—TYPE OUT THE CODE. Your muscle memory matters.

### 2. Build Projects
After every 3-4 chapters, build a small project integrating what you learned.

### 3. Debug Everything
When code doesn't work, DEBUG IT. Understanding errors teaches you more than success.

### 4. Take Notes
Keep your own notes. Explain concepts in your own words.

### 5. Practice, Practice, Practice
Complete EVERY exercise. Build MORE than what's asked.

### 6. Review Regularly
Revisit earlier chapters. Concepts build on each other.
